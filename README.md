# `Server Side Events in Go`

This project demonstrates the use of **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** with a Go server to facilitate real-time data streaming. It allows dynamic updates to an `index.html` file, providing an interactive experience for users.

## `Overview`

In this mini project, I explored the capabilities of SSE to push updates from the server to the client without requiring the client to make repeated requests. This enables efficient real-time data delivery for applications such as notifications, live updates, or dashboards.
